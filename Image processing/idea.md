# 🖼️ Image Processing Module

## 🎯 Objective
Enhance the precision of skin condition diagnosis using advanced image processing and AI techniques.

## 📋 Description
The image processing module will utilize deep learning algorithms to analyze user-uploaded skin images. It aims to identify and rank possible skin conditions based on visual similarities.

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather a diverse dataset of skin condition images
   - Preprocess images for consistency in lighting, size, and resolution.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
   - Train the model on labeled images of various skin conditions.

3. **Threshold-Based Ranking System**:
   - Implement a scoring system where each condition is given a percentage probability.
   - Conditions exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 50%) are ranked and displayed.

4. **Integration with Chatbot**:
   - The model’s output feeds into the chatbot module.
   - The chatbot uses this information to guide users towards understanding their skin condition.

## 📈 Expected Output
Upon uploading an image, the user receives a ranked list of potential skin conditions with probability percentages. For example:
- Acne: 87%
- Keratosis: 80%
- Rosacea: 60%
- *(Threshold: 50%)*
